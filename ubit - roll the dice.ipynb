    "# Roll the dice on a BBC micro:bit\n",
    "\n",
    "This little Python script implements a nice application to play the dice using a BBC micro:bit. On every press of the button `A` another random number between 1 and 6 is generated and displayed using a typical dice dot pattern on the led matrix. Keeping the button `A` pressed displays a progress animation accelerating the longer the button is pressed and slowing down after releasing the button again until the next value of the throw is displayed. Pressing the button `B` exits the main loop, which is handy when running the application in interactive mode using the [ubit_kernel](https://github.com/takluyver/ubit_kernel) in a jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise you're advised to comment the button 'B' related code and copy and paste the code into the [BBC Python online editor](http://microbit.co.uk/app/#create:xyelfe), download the resulting binary blob and copy it onto the micro:bit, when connected to your computer."
